## Description

This repository contains my submission for **Task 3** of the CODTECH Digital Marketing Internship. In this task, I was required to create a **comprehensive SEO strategy** for a website to improve its visibility, organic traffic, and search engine rankings. SEO, or Search Engine Optimization, is an essential part of digital marketing because it helps websites reach the right audience, attract potential customers, and establish credibility in a highly competitive online environment. 

To complete this task, I focused on multiple areas of SEO, including **keyword research and mapping, technical SEO, on-page optimization, off-page SEO, backlink building, local SEO (if applicable), and a detailed 90-day implementation roadmap**. The first step involved researching relevant keywords, identifying primary, secondary, and long-tail keywords, and analyzing competitors’ websites to understand which keywords perform best. I mapped these keywords to specific pages to avoid overlapping or cannibalizing search rankings. This process helped me learn how to align keywords with the search intent of potential users and how to strategically target different types of queries.

Next, I worked on **technical SEO**, optimizing the website’s structure, improving page load speed, ensuring mobile responsiveness, implementing proper indexing, and fixing broken links. Technical SEO ensures that search engines can crawl and understand the website efficiently, which is crucial for achieving higher rankings. I also included **core web vitals optimization**, which focuses on page speed, visual stability, and interactivity. This hands-on experience helped me understand the importance of technical factors in website performance and user experience.

For **on-page SEO**, I optimized meta titles, meta descriptions, headers, internal linking, and images. I also included a content optimization strategy, ensuring that all website content is high-quality, keyword-focused, and aligned with user intent. For **off-page SEO**, I developed a backlink strategy that focuses on acquiring high-quality, niche-relevant links through guest posting, outreach, social signals, and other white-hat techniques. I also included a section on **local SEO**, which is especially important for location-based businesses to improve visibility on Google Maps and local searches.

Finally, I created a **90-day implementation roadmap** that outlines tasks week by week, ensuring that the SEO strategy can be applied in a structured and measurable way. I also prepared a **final checklist** that summarizes all essential actions for successful execution.

All of my work is compiled in a **Word document** and a **PDF version**, which contain tables, keyword maps, checklists, and step-by-step guidelines. Completing this task has significantly enhanced my understanding of SEO strategies, both theoretically and practically, and this submission reflects my learning and effort during the internship.
